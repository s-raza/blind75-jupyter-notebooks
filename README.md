Blind75 Practice Notebooks
==========================

Jupyter notebooks setup with the tests and test cases from [leetcode](http://www.leetcode.com) for the recommended 8 weeks/8 hours per week schedule from [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?grouping=topics), grouped by problem topics.

These problems are designed to be worked on [in order](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75/faq).

To jump right into practicing, clone the repository and open it in VSCode with the jupyter extension installed. It maybe required to modify the `Jupyter: Notebook File Root` setting in vscode to `${workspaceFolder} OR ${fileDirname}` to ensure that the imports for the solvers and testers work as expected.

_Note: The 75 problems in this repository are from the recomended 8/8 hours/week schedule from [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?grouping=topics) and can differ from other Blind75 problems list found elsewhere on the Inernet_
